Description:
Developed a machine learning model to classify text messages as spam or ham using a comprehensive pipeline of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, text preprocessing, and model building. Employed various machine learning algorithms to enhance model performance.

Techniques Used:

Data Cleaning:

Dropped irrelevant columns and handled missing values.
Renamed columns for clarity.
Encoded categorical labels.
Removed duplicate records to ensure data quality.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized target distribution using pie charts.
Calculated and analyzed message lengths, word counts, and sentence counts.
Employed histograms and pair plots to understand data distributions.
Text Preprocessing:

Converted text to lowercase and tokenized.
Removed special characters, stop words, and punctuation.
Applied stemming to reduce words to their root forms.
Feature Engineering:

Used TF-IDF vectorization to transform text data into numerical features.
Model Building:

Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models including Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees, and ensemble methods.
Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
Model Improvement:

Fine-tuned hyperparameters and tested various algorithms.
Applied ensemble techniques like Voting Classifier and Stacking for improved performance.
Tools and Technologies:

Python, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud
This project demonstrates proficiency in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning, showcasing the ability to build and deploy effective text classification models.
