# Spam Detection Model Project

## Description
Developed a machine learning model to classify text messages as spam or ham using a comprehensive pipeline of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, text preprocessing, and model building. Employed various machine learning algorithms to enhance model performance.

## Techniques Used

### Data Cleaning
- Dropped irrelevant columns and handled missing values.
- Renamed columns for clarity.
- Encoded categorical labels.
- Removed duplicate records to ensure data quality.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized target distribution using pie charts.
- Calculated and analyzed message lengths, word counts, and sentence counts.
- Employed histograms and pair plots to understand data distributions.

### Text Preprocessing
- Converted text to lowercase and tokenized.
- Removed special characters, stop words, and punctuation.
- Applied stemming to reduce words to their root forms.

### Feature Engineering
- Used TF-IDF vectorization to transform text data into numerical features.

### Model Building
- Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models including Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees, and ensemble methods.
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

### Model Improvement
- Fine-tuned hyperparameters and tested various algorithms.
- Applied ensemble techniques like Voting Classifier and Stacking for improved performance.
